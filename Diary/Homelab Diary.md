## 2025-09-28
### Progress
- Planned homelab rebuild after repurposing old gaming PC.
- Decided to install **Proxmox VE** as the hypervisor.
- Wiped SSDs with GParted to prepare for fresh installs.
- Initial runbook structure drafted (Proxmox Chapter 1, OPNsense Chapter 2).

### Notes
- Using ZFS for drive layout.
- Secure Boot disabled for Proxmox compatibility.
- Networking goal: 2.5Gb to devices, 10Gb SFP+ backbone between router, NAS, switch, and server.

---

## 2025-09-29
### Progress
- Chose **OPNsense** over pfSense (UI, Suricata IDS, flexibility).
- Decided to add **Pi-hole** for DNS/ad-blocking.
- VLAN design planned:
  - VLAN 10: Main LAN
  - VLAN 20: IoT/Home Automation
  - VLAN 30: Guest
  - VLAN 40: Lab/Sandbox
- Created initial network diagram with trunk lines between switches.

### Notes
- Need managed switches for VLAN support (unmanaged won‚Äôt cut it).
- Considering cheap managed switches with 10Gb uplinks + 2.5Gb downlinks.

---

## 2025-09-30
### Progress
- Added more services to planned stack:
  - **Home Assistant**, **Heimdall**, **Linkding**, **Homebox**, **LanguageTool**, **Uptime Kuma**, **Portainer**.
- Documented backup plan: **Veeam ‚Üí NAS ‚Üí Cloud**.
- Decided to track everything in Git/Obsidian, with custom VM/App IDs.
- Finalized **hybrid ID scheme** (VMIDs for Proxmox, AppIDs nested for Docker containers).
- Created runbook entries for each VM and container with VLANs + IPs.

### Notes
- Started thinking about custom backgrounds per VM/app to make them visually distinct.
- Planned Raspberry Pi with NUT to manage UPS events.
- Documented plan to P2V (physical-to-virtual) the LLM in future.

---

## 2025-10-01
### Progress
- Updated runbook with hybrid **ID scheme** (VMIDs + AppIDs).
- Added extra devices (consoles, 3D printers, Hue hub, NUT Pi) into Markdown + diagram.
- Created **`debian-lab (9000)`** VM for sandbox/pentesting (VLAN 40).
- Created **Docker VM (`apps`, 200)**:
  - 50 GB disk, 4 GB RAM, 2 vCPU, DHCP networking (temporary).
  - Hostname set to `apps`.
- Installed **Docker CE + Compose** from official Docker repo:
  - Fixed malformed sources.list entry.
  - Imported GPG key properly.
  - Verified `docker --version` and `docker compose version`.
- Ready for first test stack (Portainer/Heimdall) tomorrow.

### Notes
- OPNsense not yet deployed (waiting on extra NIC).
- Docker VM left on DHCP until OPNsense controls LAN.
- Lab diary started today to track incremental progress.

### Next Steps
- Deploy a small test stack (Portainer or Heimdall) on `apps (200)`.
- Install OPNsense once new NIC arrives.
- Assign static IPs/DNS (10.20.10.x) after OPNsense is live.

## 2025-10-02
### Progress
- ‚úÖ SSH into `apps (200)` as **ellie** via MobaXterm; copy/paste sorted.
- ‚úÖ Installed **qemu-guest-agent** on `apps` (Proxmox now shows IP).
- ‚úÖ Deployed containers:
  - Portainer (fixed env to **Docker local** via `/var/run/docker.sock`)
  - Heimdall
  - Linkding (set superuser via env; changed password after login)
  - Uptime Kuma
  - Homebox
  - LanguageTool (API up on :8010)
- ‚úÖ Obsidian vault is now the **GitHub repo**; committed & pushed changes.
- ‚úÖ Added README seed files so folders show on GitHub.

### Notes
- `apps` currently on **DHCP 192.168.8.180**; will become **10.20.10.20** after OPNsense.
- LanguageTool extension ‚ÄúLocal server‚Äù wants **localhost**; will tunnel or switch to Traefik later.
- Git/GitHub: Windows is case-insensitive; GitHub isn‚Äôt. Folder case (`Docs` vs `docs`) needs a two-step rename to reflect online.

### Issues / Gotchas
- Initial Portainer wizard picked Podman ‚Üí snapshot error; removed Podman env, added **Docker ‚Üí Local**.
- GitHub Desktop kept stale `origin` after remote deletion ‚Üí removed remote, republished.
- Empty folders don‚Äôt show on GitHub ‚Üí added `README.md` in each.

### Next Steps (tomorrow)
- [ ] Rename `Docs ‚Üí docs` and subfolders properly (two-step rename: `Docs ‚Üí docs_tmp ‚Üí docs`), then commit/push.
- [ ] Move/runbooks into `docs/runbook/` (Portainer, Heimdall, Linkding, Kuma, Homebox, LT, Vaultwarden).
- [ ] Add `docs/runbook/README.md` index and update links if casing changed.
- [ ] (Optional quick win) Deploy **Vaultwarden** on port 8081 (compose ready).
- [ ] Prepare **Traefik** plan (after OPNsense): HTTPS + hostnames.
- [ ] Post-network: set static IPs + Pi-hole/OPNsense DNS A-records for services.
- [ ] Later hardening: SSH keys everywhere; disable password auth.

### Tiny Wins to Celebrate
- Six containers live in one evening üéâ
- Repo + Obsidian finally in sync.
- Guest agent installed‚Äîno more ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my IP?‚Äù guessing.


# 2025-10-03

## Progress
- **Pi-hole (CT 230):** Installed and working. Wired to **Unbound (recursive)** on `127.0.0.1#5335`. Pi-hole DNSSEC disabled (Unbound validates). Gravity updated.
- **Home Assistant (VM 220):** Created (`homeassistant`, 2 vCPU, 6 GB RAM, 100 GB). Onboarding in progress; migration from Pi planned via full backup.
- **DuckDNS:** Up and running for dynamic DNS.
- **WireGuard (CT 233):** Created (unprivileged, TUN+keyctl). `wg0` configured; **WGDashboard** installed and login fixed. Dashboard on `http://192.168.8.184:10086` (LAN-only).
- **Passwords:** Stored in Bitwarden (cloud) for now; plan to self-host Vaultwarden later.

## Notes
- WGDashboard password issue was INI parsing‚Äîsymbols can be problematic. Using a strong password without `#` or `;` works reliably.
- No peers yet; add **phone peer (10.6.0.2/32)** via dashboard when ready.
- Keep dashboard LAN-only. Do **not** port-forward 10086.

## Next Steps (tomorrow / weekend)
- OPNsense prep: buy/install 2nd NIC, then install OPNsense.
- Move services to target subnets once VLANs exist:
  - Pi-hole ‚Üí **10.20.10.21** (VLAN 10)
  - WireGuard CT ‚Üí **10.20.10.24** (VLAN 10)
  - Home Assistant ‚Üí **10.20.20.20** (VLAN 20 / IoT)
- OPNsense DHCP: set **Option 6** to Pi-hole IP.
- Open **UDP 51820** on OPNsense and restrict `WG_NET (10.6.0.0/24)`.
- Consider migrating HA from Pi via full backup; attach USB radios to VM.
- Add runbooks to repo (Plex, Vaultwarden) when you‚Äôre ready; hold off to save RAM.

## Quick Wins
- Add one mobile peer in WGDashboard and test handshake + DNS via Pi-hole.
- Snapshot Pi-hole, WireGuard CTs, and HA VM baselines in Proxmox.

# üóìÔ∏è Daily Diary ‚Äî 2025-10-05

## Summary
Big win. Reinstalled Proxmox cleanly, reattached VM storage, restored configs, and verified all core services. Lab is back online.

## What I did
- Reinstalled **Proxmox VE 8 (bookworm)** on NVMe boot disk.
- Mounted 1TB **VM-Storage** (`/mnt/pve/VM-Storage`) and made it persistent via `/etc/fstab`.
- Verified backups present: `pve-configs.tgz`, `host-scripts.tgz`, `cron*/`, `etc-ssl/`.
- Restored configs:
  - Extracted `pve-configs.tgz` ‚Üí copied into node paths under `/etc/pve/nodes/<hostname>/{qemu-server,lxc}`.
  - Restarted `pve-cluster`, `pvedaemon`, `pveproxy`.
- Brought guests up, one-by-one, confirmed dashboards load:
  - **Apps VM (Docker)** ‚Äî Heimdall, Portainer, Linkding, Homebox, LanguageTool, Uptime Kuma, DuckDNS ‚úîÔ∏é
  - **Home Assistant VM** ‚úîÔ∏é
  - **Pi-hole LXC** ‚úîÔ∏é
  - **WireGuard LXC** (WGDashboard accessible) ‚úîÔ∏é
- Wrote/added runbooks & cheat sheets:
  - `proxmox-clean-reinstall.md`
  - `proxmox-restore.md`
  - `restore-configs.md`
  - `fstab-recovery.md`
  - `disaster-recovery-lessons.md`

## Issues / Notes
- SSH/SCP timeouts earlier‚Äîbypassed by placing backups on the VM-Storage disk.
- Proxmox service reload took a while; resolved after proper config placement + restart.
- NVIDIA drivers postponed to avoid dependency hell until base is stable.

## Next actions (short-term)
- Install **NVIDIA drivers** for Plex HW transcoding (tomorrow).
- Confirm static DHCP reservations for: Proxmox, Apps VM, Pi-hole, WG, HA.
- Snapshot each VM/LXC now that they‚Äôre healthy.

## Next actions (mid-term)
- OPNsense build when the new NIC arrives (initially flat LAN; VLANs later with managed switch & AP).
- Consider **PBS + offsite backups**.
- Add **Watchtower** for container updates and finalize maintenance script cadence.

## Mood / Energy
- Tired but relieved. Ruby approved (eventually). üêæ
